Hi! I'm Lukas, am PhD-student at the psychology department of the University of Amsterdam, supervised by [Dr. Steven Scholte](https://www.uva.nl/profiel/s/c/h.s.scholte/h.s.scholte.html) and [Dr. Suzanne Oosterwijk](https://sites.google.com/site/suzanneoosterwijk/). I’m interested in the neural representation of affective processes such as emotion experience and (facial) emotion perception.

Additionally, I’m a methods nerd, interested in novel analyses and statistical methods (for fMRI). Next to my research, I work at the Spinoza Centre for Neuroimaging (location "Roeterseiland" at the UvA), where I provide technical assistance and develop software for automated data management and preprocessing. Throughout the years, I developed a passion for open and transparent (neuro)science, to which I aim to contribute by making my data publicly available and by working on various open-source projects aimed at improving methodological rigor, transparency, and reproducibility.

As part of my PhD, I also teach two courses on neuroimaging (*Neuroimaging: BOLD fMRI* and *Neuroimaging: pattern analysis*), in which I aim to teach students how to properly analyze and interpret fMRI data.

You can find more information about my [research](research.md), [software](software.md), [data](data.md) and [teaching](teaching.md) on this website. To be informed about new research, data, or software, it's probably best to follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/LukasSnoek) and/or [Github](https://github.com/lukassnoek).
