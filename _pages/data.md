Throughout my PhD, I have acquired several MRI datasets and my goal is to make all data publicly available before my PhD ends. For an overview of the datasets that I've made publicly available (or plan to), see below.

## [SharedStates](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002547)
This [3T fMRI dataset](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002547) belongs to the article "Shared states: using MVPA to test neural overlap between self-focused emotion imagery and other-focused emotion understanding" ([url](https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/12/7/1025/3798709)). Per subject, it contains a single T1-weighted anatomical scan, three functional (BOLD) scans, and associated physiology (respiration and cardiac traces) data. 

## AOMIC (in progress)
Currently, I'm working on publishing collection of MRI datasets (AOMIC: the Amsterdam Open MRI Collection), containing multimodal 3T MRI data from over 1300 subjects. We aim to release the data in December 2019. Want to know more?
