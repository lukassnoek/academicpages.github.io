Throughout my PhD, I have acquired several MRI datasets and my goal is to make all data publicly available before I finish my PhD. For an overview of the datasets that I've made publicly available (or plan to), see below.

## AOMIC
The Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) contains three datasets with multimodal MRI data and extensive physiological and behavioral data. More information about the dataset can be found on [this website](https://nilab-uva.github.io/AOMIC.github.io/) or in our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.155317v2). Or check the Twitter thread below for a TL;DR.

## SharedStates
This [3T fMRI dataset](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002547) belongs to the [article](https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/12/7/1025/3798709) "Shared states: using MVPA to test neural overlap between self-focused emotion imagery and other-focused emotion understanding". Per subject, it contains a single T1-weighted anatomical scan, three functional (BOLD) scans, and associated physiology (respiration and cardiac traces) data. 

## MB-EPI-comparison
At the Spinoza Centre for Neuroimaging, we tested several multiband EPI sequences for functional MRI research in which we varied the temporal and spatial resolution. The data from 23 participants can be viewed and downloaded [here](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002603).
For more information about this dataset, check out the Twitter thread below.

## dStreamUpgrade
Our 3T Philips Achieva scanner got a major (dStream) upgrade in 2017. This upgrade allows the scanner to digitize the signal a lot earlier than before, theoretically improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) a lot. To investigate this, we acquired data from the same 24 subjects using the same scan sequences (T1-weighted structural MRI, task-based and resting-state functional MRI, and DWI) before and after the upgrade. The raw and preprocessed data is available on [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003495) and the (differences in) temporal SNR maps and activation maps can be found on [NeuroVault](https://identifiers.org/neurovault.collection:9401).
