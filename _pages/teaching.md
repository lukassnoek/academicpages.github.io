As part of my PhD, I co-teach two courses about (functional) MRI analyses at the Research Master Psychology (U. of Amsterdam), which I love doing! 

## Courses
A large part of the two (f)MRI analysis courses that I co-teach (with [Noor Seijdel](http://www.noorseijdel.com/) and [Steven Scholte](https://www.uva.nl/profiel/s/c/h.s.scholte/h.s.scholte.html)) consists of programming tutorials/exercises in the form of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). These notebooks walk students through the most important concepts of the course's topics by showing how certain ideas, operations, and models can be implemented in (and visualized with) Python code. Importantly, these notebooks contain many excersises ("ToThinks" and "ToDos") to make students actively engage with the material. Before the end of my PhD, I aim to make the notebooks from the two courses publicly available.

### Introduction to (f)MRI
In this eight-week (6 EC) course, we discuss the process of (functional) MRI data analysis and interpretation. The course consists of weekly lectures, computer labs (with Python-based Jupyter notebooks), and interactive seminars. The course has a practical focus (i.e., how you implement analyses) and is centered around my favorite statistical model, the general linear model (GLM), and how it is applied in the context of (functional) MRI data analysis.

We are in the process of fully open-sourcing the material. For more information, check the [NI-edu website](https://neuroimaging-uva.github.io/NI-edu). To check out the notebooks directly, check the associated [Github repository](https://github.com/Neuroimaging-UvA/NI-edu).

### Pattern analysis
In this four-week (3 EC) course, we discuss a specific subset of neuroimaging analyses: pattern analyses (also known as MVPA or information-based analysis). We mainly focus on machine-learning based analyses ("decoding") and representational similarity analysis (RSA). We aim to release the materials sometime mid-2020 (on the same [website](https://neuroimaging-uva.github.io/NI-edu) and [Github repository](https://github.com/Neuroimaging-UvA/NI-edu)).
