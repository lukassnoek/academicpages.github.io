At the University of Amsterdam, I (co-)teach several courses related to neuroimaging, (Python) programming, and statistics and methodology, including machine learning and AI. I have made some of the material I developed for these courses publicly accessible, as described below.

## NI-edu
Together with [Noor Seijdel](http://www.noorseijdel.com) and [Steven Scholte](https://www.uva.nl/profiel/s/c/h.s.scholte/h.s.scholte.html), I (re)designed and developed two courses about functional MRI analysis: *Neuroimaging: BOLD-MRI* and the follow-up course *Neuroimaging: pattern analysis*. Under the name *NI-edu*, I released the hands-on programming tutorials from these courses on the following website: [https://lukas-snoek.com/NI-edu](https://lukas-snoek.com/NI-edu).

## introPy
The Research Master Psychology at the University of Amsterdam offers a full-time, four-week introductory programming course ("Programming in Psychological Science"). This course includes a two-week introduction to [R](https://www.r-project.org/) followed by two weeks of advanced R or a two-week introduction to Python and the stimulus presentation program PsychoPy, which I developed. Like the fMRI courses, I made all the material publicly accessible on the following website: [https://lukas-snoek.com/introPy](https://lukas-snoek.com/introPy).

## The Psychology of AI
This eight-week course features a new topic related to psychology and artificial intelligence, ranging from "good old fashioned AI" to deep learning to AI ethics. For this course, I created two introductory tutorials about neural networks for which students do not need any programming experience. Check them out below!

### Building neural networks in your browser
This tutorial uses the online [Tensorflow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) app to introduce students to the idea of simple ("fully-connected") neural networks. View it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSENVbx9nuIWyvDiuHd7mNc0SaI9Yapadjwm5iXN7GXIWZ92tAf9NqdnD5Bb4YH3Vqb8VeG_PAM1aoY/pub)!

### An introduction to convolutional neural networks
This tutorial focuses on *convolutional* neural networks (CNNs) and leverages the excellent [CNN explainer](https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/) web app to explain the key concepts behind CNNs. View it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT18r6F_RXSZGBfQia_1GTjmXVG95LRQncvPoiG5-LWCGd6suJ4CxsNtIUbHtK-9sdT4q58rEhTAb9L/pub)!

### Creating your own CNN
For one of the group assignments of this course, students have to create, train, and evaluate their own CNN model on a topic/dataset of their choice using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/). Check out the tutorial/assignment [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRzXVmKS4lFcpO2fu97979Wo2VOTDsrJK_92-P7Eczv2o2x4FPlOtf8ELYBtPstnU4d2arns7dAJxfC/pub)!
